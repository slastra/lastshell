# Run lastshell inside a nested Hyprland, so shell development never touches
# the session you are sitting in. Modeled on
# ~/Projects/Rust/hoja/scripts/sway-harness.sh, but the nested compositor is
# Hyprland rather than sway: half the shell (workspaces widget, socket2
# events, Hyprland.dispatch) speaks Hyprland IPC that sway cannot provide.

# interactive poking (Ctrl-C tears it down). With one, sources it with:

#   $NWL        nested WAYLAND_DISPLAY      key ...      wtype args, nested scope
#   $HIS        nested HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE
#   hyp ...     hyprctl against the nested instance
#   click X Y   left-click at nested coords (wlrctl virtual pointer)
#
# grim/wtype/wlrctl all scope to $NWL, never the host. ydotool is banned here
# for the same reason it is in the hoja harness: uinput lands on whatever the
# real session has focused.
